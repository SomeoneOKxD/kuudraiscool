# Download and Install kuudraiscool (KIC)

**kuudraiscool (KIC)** is a Forge mod for **Minecraft 1.8.9 only**.  
Running KIC on Badlion, Lunar, Feather, or newer versions of Minecraft is **not supported**.

Follow this guide to install KIC in regular Minecraft Forge.  
If you already have Forge mods, you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, start from step 1.

---

> ### 1: Run vanilla 1.8.9
> Run Minecraft 1.8.9, unmodded, for 10 seconds, then close it.

> ### 2: Install Java
> To play with mods, you need Java 8.  
> Install [Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/).  
> Double-click the file to install it.

> ### 3: Install Forge
> Forge is the system that loads your mods into the game.  
> You need Java to run Forge.  
> Download [Forge for 1.8.9](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9/forge-1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9-installer.jar).  
> When you double-click the file, install as *client*.  
> If Forge does not open with Java, download [Jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html), double-click it, then try running Forge again.

> ### 4: Download kuudraiscool (KIC)
> Download the latest release of KIC from GitHub:  
> [KIC Releases](https://github.com/SomeoneOKxD/kuudraiscool/releases)  
> It is recommended to use the latest **release version** unless you're testing something specific.

> ### 5: Find `.minecraft`
> Once you have downloaded KIC, navigate to your `.minecraft` folder:
> - **Windows**: Open File Explorer and type `%appdata%` into the address bar, then open `.minecraft`.
> - **Mac**: Open Finder, click "Go" > "Go to Folder", then enter `~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft`.
> - **Linux**: Go to your home folder and open `.minecraft` (i.e., `~/.minecraft`).

> ### 6: Move mod into `mods` folder
> If there is a `mods` folder, open it. Otherwise, create one and name it exactly `mods`.  
> Move the KIC `.jar` file into the `mods` folder.  
> Remove any older versions of KIC to avoid conflicts.  
> *Note: If you encounter a problem, support may ask for a screenshot of your mods folder.*

> ### 7: Setup RAM
> Running mods requires more RAM:
> - Check your system's RAM [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/435644/how-to-see-how-much-ram-is-in-your-pc-and-its-speed/).
> - Open Minecraft Launcher > **Installations** > click the 3 dots > **Edit** > **More Options**.
> - Locate `-Xmx2G` or similar in JVM Arguments:
    >   - If you have **4GB RAM**, use `-Xmx2G`.
>   - If you have **8GB+ RAM**, use `-Xmx4G`.
> - Do not go above 4GB unless you're using many mods.

> ### 8: Launch the Forge profile
> Forge should have created a new profile.  
> If not:
> - Go to **Installations** > **New Installation**
> - Under version, select `release 1.8.9-forge-11.15.1.2318` (or similar)

> ### 9: Recommended additional mods (optional)
> These are not required, but improve performance:
> - [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=preview_OptiFine_1.8.9_HD_U_M6_pre2.jar) â€“ Enhances FPS and graphics.
> - [Sk1erLLC's Patcher](https://sk1er.club/mods/patcher) or [Polyfrost's PolyPatcher](https://modrinth.com/mod/patcher) â€“ Bug fixes and additional settings.
