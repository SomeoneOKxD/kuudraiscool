# Kuudraiscool (KIC)

**Kuudraiscool (KIC)** is a **Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 mod** for **Hypixel SkyBlock**, originally built to improve the **Kuudra gameplay**, but now expanded with a growing set of **quality-of-life features**.

This mod started as a simple ChatTriggers module, but has since been rewritten from the ground up in Java as a full Forge mod â€” giving it more power, performance, and potential.
